# Project: _Open_CV_Cam_read_
## Overview:
Continuing on previous Open CV programs, I made a simple code to read the device's cameras through Open CV.
## Set up:
1. I used Open CV combining with Python on Visual Studio code to read and show the Video (you don't have to use Visual Studio code). You will need to download Open cv using the terminal. Once you have opened it, you should enter this command:  "pip install opencv-python" for the automatical download of the latest version.
2. Your device must be equipped with at least a camera for the project.
## Some tips:
1. If you get an error with "pip", you may also try "pip3" instead.
2. You should also run the code directly on terminal.
3. If you have 2 or more cameras on the gadget, you can also change the cam id to switch to the cam you want (cam id can either be: 0; 1; 2; ...).
